        <p>This is an exchange room. Beyond this page, on a server, lies the content of the third
            M.e.e.t.i.n.g.p.o.i.n.t. publication: &ldquo;In the institute&rdquo;, a song and video composition by
            Hrefna Sigur&eth;ard&oacute;ttir.</p>
        <p>Although we do not ask for any type of monetary exchange, instead, we&rsquo;d like you to
            submit [?] a single file of your own choice in exchange for the mp4 publication.
            So! At the moment you are nowhere. You are situated in plasma, in goo &ndash; in limbo. Not
            much to do here but decide which file you&rsquo;d like to submit. What size, what type, which
            genre...or if you&rsquo;d like to submit one at all.</p>
        <p>You, the visitor, may be coming to this room from different operating systems and not
            all of you are looking through the same type of browser or screen. This may mean that
            the file extensions hosted on your computer are different, and the type of file may differ
            as well. Maybe you are interested or invested in vastly different subjects which probably
            also controls what kind of files you have saved on your machine.</p>
        <p>And this might result in a quite eclectic collection of digital objects. But that is somewhat
            what we are trying to create &ndash; a collection. Just some collection that we will later on
            re-order, re-frame and re-publish, with your consent, of course.</p>
        <br><p>AND if this page is plasma, the buttons above then act as the membrane that sucks in or
            spits out the documents exchanged.</p>
        <p>As you upload, add your name and a title if you&rsquo;d like.
        </p>
        <p>We wonder how you will choose your file...
